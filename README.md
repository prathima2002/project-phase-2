**Prediction Of Smartphone Addiciton using Machine Learning**

**About**
Smartphone addiction has become a growing concern in recent years, with increasing numbers of people exhibiting symptoms such as excessive phone use, loss of productivity, and even physical and psychological health problems. As a result, there is a need to develop effective tools for predicting smartphone addiction and identifying those at risk.In this study, we developed a machine learning model for predicting smartphone addiction using data collected from a survey of smartphone users.

**Features**
Data Preparation: Thorough cleaning and preprocessing of kaggle website data.
Modeling Techniques: Utilization of algorithms and analysis for accurate predictions.
Model Evaluation: models using decision tree,logistic regression,random forest.

**Requirements**
Operating System   : Windows 7/8/10.
Server side Script : HTML,CSS & JS.
IDE                : Pycharm.

**Results**:

A primary objective of the present study is to find the degree of smart phone addiction, for which 15 independent questions are considered for building the machine learning based prediction model. We initially investigated if there is any difference across male and female cell-phone users in terms of the cell-phone activities used.
